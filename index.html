<br>Lebanon, located on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, is a small yet culturally rich country in the Middle East.
Known for its diverse history, stunning landscapes, and vibrant cities,
Lebanon offers a unique blend of ancient ruins, modern architecture, and scenic beauty.
The capital city, Beirut, serves as a bustling cultural hub, renowned for its lively nightlife, eclectic cuisine,
and historical landmarks. Throughout its history, Lebanon has been influenced by various civilizations,
including Phoenician, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, and Ottoman, resulting in a rich tapestry of traditions and heritage.
Despite its relatively small size, Lebanon boasts a diverse topography, ranging from the fertile Bekaa Valley and
picturesque Mediterranean coastline to the rugged mountains of Mount Lebanon. This diversity provides ample opportunities
for outdoor activities such as skiing, hiking, and beach outings.
However, Lebanon also faces challenges, including political instability, economic hardships, and social tensions. Despite 
these challenges, the resilience and spirit of the Lebanese people continue to shine through, making Lebanon a fascinating
and dynamic destination for travelers and a testament to the enduring human spirit.</p>

  <p>In 1943 Lebanon gained independence and adopted a flag
     made up of a white field with two horizontal red stripes at 
     the top and bottom with a green cedar tree in the centre.
